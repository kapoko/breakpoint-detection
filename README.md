# breakpoint-detection ðŸ’”

Pure Javascript breakpoint detection for Bootstrap. Written in ES6 so only supports ES6 projects for now. 

Heavily inpsired on [Maciej Gurban's Responsive Bootstrap Toolkit](https://github.com/maciej-gurban/responsive-bootstrap-toolkit), even uses some of the same code, but I needed a version without jQuery dependency. Did things a little different for some performance improvements. 

Will need some improvements and testing before public use. Will publish to NPM later.
